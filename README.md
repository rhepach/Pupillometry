# Pupillometry

Here you will find the video stimuli used in our studies to measure changes in pupil dilation.

# Folder: 1st_generation

This includes the original stimuli used in our first study.

# Folder: 2nd_generation_FullHDres

The sequence of the clips for one measurement (i.e., two elicitations of a pupillary light reflex) is:

blue_qu1 -> blue640_qu_1 -> blue640_qu_2

*or

purple_qu1 -> purple640_qu_1 -> purple640_qu_2

The clips blue_loop or purple_loop can by used instead of blue_qu1 or purple_qu1 to cue the measurement sequence until blue640_qu_1 or purple640_qu_1 is initiated with a key press (ending the presentation of blue_loop or purple_loop).

There are both avi- and wmv-versions in the respective folders.

The stimuli were used in the following studies:

# Folder: Calibration_stimuli

This contains the calibration stimulus and still frames as used in 

*Hepach, R., Vaish, A., Grossmann, T., & Tomasello, M. (2016). Young children want to see others get the help they need. Child Development, 87(6), 1703-1714.
